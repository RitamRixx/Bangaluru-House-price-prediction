# Bengaluru House Price Prediction

## Overview
This project involves predicting house prices in Bengaluru using machine learning techniques. The goal is to develop an AI-powered model that accurately estimates the market value of residential properties based on various features such as size, location, number of bedrooms (BHK), and more.

## Project Description
During my internship at Feyn Labs, I worked on a project aimed at predicting house prices in Bengaluru. The project involved data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model building. I utilized various regression algorithms to develop a predictive model that could estimate house prices based on input features.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization)
- Scikit-learn (for machine learning)
- XGBoost (for advanced model building)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the **Bengaluru House Data**, available on Kaggle. The dataset contains information on various properties in Bengaluru, including:
- Size of the house
- Location
- Price
- Number of bedrooms (BHK)
- Number of bathrooms

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA phase involved analyzing the dataset to understand the distribution of variables, identifying missing values, and visualizing relationships between features. Key insights from the analysis include:
- Distribution of prices based on various factors.
- Correlation between features and target variable (price).
- Identification and handling of outliers.

## Model Building
Multiple regression algorithms were employed to build the predictive model, including:
- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
- Gradient Boosting Regressor

The model's performance was evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (RÂ²).
